# Command Pattern app

This is a simple browser app containing a terminal interface to a virtual shell which will execute the user's input. The app's architecture runs a [command pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) for parsing and sending your text input to the invoker via a scoped Javascript Function, and includes a simple undo-redo history.
